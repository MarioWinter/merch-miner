# PROJ-25: Bulk ASIN One-Shot Scrape Batches

## Status: Planned
**Created:** 2026-05-05
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-05

## Summary
Admin uploads an XLSX/CSV file with N ASINs (10 to 800k+), gets a `BulkScrapeBatch` record. With a manual 2-click action ("Open batch" → "Start"), a drainer-loop scrapes every ASIN exactly once at maximum allowed throughput, paced by a live-tunable global concurrency limit (`ScraperConfig.concurrent_requests`). The system never crashes regardless of file size: targets are inserted with `active=False` in chunks, the drainer activates and enqueues only as many as the global slot pool permits at any moment, and limit changes propagate within 10 seconds.

This feature unblocks the planned 800k Merch by Amazon seed scrape (see memory `project_800k_scrape_strategy.md`) and gives the admin step-wise rollout: 10 → 50 → 1k → 100k.

## Dependencies
- Requires: PROJ-16 (Amazon Product Scraper) — reuses `selectors.py`, ScraperOps middleware, `worker-scraper` queue, item pipeline
- Requires: PROJ-23 (Selector Health Check) — not a hard dependency, but the canary infrastructure should be green before any 100k+ batch is started so we detect drift early

## User Stories
- As an admin, I want to upload an XLSX of N ASINs (any size between 10 and 800k+) and have the file parsed in the background so the browser never times out.
- As an admin, I want a `BulkScrapeBatch` record per upload that tracks parse status, total/pending/running/done/failed counts, and a list of recent errors, so I can see at a glance whether an upload is healthy.
- As an admin, I want a 2-click "Start Batch" action that begins the scrape so nothing runs accidentally on upload.
- As an admin, I want the system to scrape ASINs in 10-ASIN chunks via a single batch spider so I get full ScraperOps slot utilization without spawning hundreds of subprocesses.
- As an admin, I want to change `ScraperConfig.concurrent_requests` from 50 to 25 mid-run and have the system adjust throughput within 10 seconds without crashing or losing data.
- As an admin, I want to Pause / Resume / Cancel / Retry-Failed a running batch so I can react to monitoring signals or ScraperOps quota events.
- As an admin, I want failed ASINs auto-retried once before they are marked failed for good, so transient network errors don't manually pile up.
- As an admin, I want all batches to remain in the system as history (never auto-deleted) so I can audit past seed runs.
- As an ops engineer, I want the number of `worker-scraper` replicas to be controlled by an env var (`BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS`, default 5) so I can tune the deployment without code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Data Model
- [ ] AC-1: New model `BulkScrapeBatch` with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (text), `source_filename` (text), `marketplace` (choice from `MarketplaceChoices`, default `amazon_com`), `status` (choice: `DRAFT` / `PARSING` / `PARSE_FAILED` / `READY` / `RUNNING` / `PAUSED` / `COMPLETED` / `CANCELLED`), `total_count` / `pending_count` / `running_count` / `done_count` / `failed_count` (all `PositiveInteger`, default 0), `errors` (JSONField, default list — parse + drainer warnings, capped at last 100), `created_by` (FK User, nullable), `created_at` / `started_at` / `finished_at` (datetime, nullable where appropriate).
- [ ] AC-2: `ScheduledScrapeTarget` gains nullable FK `batch` → `BulkScrapeBatch` (`on_delete=CASCADE`) and nullable `last_error` text field.
- [ ] AC-3: `ScrapeJob.Mode` gains a new value `BATCH_ASIN`. `ScrapeJob` gains nullable JSONField `asin_list` (max 10 ASINs per row, validator enforced) and nullable FK `batch` → `BulkScrapeBatch` (`on_delete=SET_NULL`).
- [ ] AC-4: `ScraperConfig` gains three new fields: `batch_size` (PositiveInteger, default 10, min 1, max 50, help_text "ASINs per batch spider subprocess"), `max_retries_per_asin` (PositiveInteger, default 1), and `fresh_skip_days` (PositiveInteger, default 30, help_text "Skip ASINs whose AmazonProduct was updated within this many days unless batch has force_rescrape=True").
- [ ] AC-5: A data migration seeds the `OneShot` `ScrapeTier` (name=`OneShot`, `bsr_min=0`, `bsr_max=null`, `interval_days=999999`) if it does not already exist. The seed is idempotent.

### Upload (Admin → Async Parser)
- [ ] AC-6: Admin URL `/admin/scraper_app/bulkscrapebatch/upload/` accepts a CSV or XLSX file, a free-text `name`, a `marketplace` choice, and a `force_rescrape` checkbox (default unchecked). The upload form is reachable via a button on the `BulkScrapeBatch` changelist.
- [ ] AC-7: On submit, the file is saved to `MEDIA_ROOT/bulk_uploads/<batch_uuid>.<ext>`, a `BulkScrapeBatch` row is created with `status=PARSING`, and a django-rq job `parse_bulk_upload_job(batch_id)` is enqueued onto the `default` queue. The browser is redirected to the batch detail page within 1 second; the file is never parsed in the request cycle.
- [ ] AC-8: `parse_bulk_upload_job` streams the file with `openpyxl.load_workbook(read_only=True, data_only=True)` (XLSX) or `csv.DictReader` (CSV), bulk-creates `ScheduledScrapeTarget` rows in chunks of 1000 with `tier=OneShot`, `active=False`, `tier_override=True`, `batch=<this batch>`. Required columns: `asin`. Optional columns: `marketplace` (overrides batch default per row). Any other columns are ignored. Numeric ASIN cells are zero-padded to 10 chars.
- [ ] AC-9: Invalid rows (ASIN not matching `^[A-Z0-9]{10}$`, unknown marketplace) are skipped, counted, and the first 100 errors appended to `batch.errors`. After parsing: `batch.status` becomes `READY` (parse OK, ≥1 valid row) or `PARSE_FAILED` (zero valid rows, or required columns missing, or file unreadable). `total_count` is set to the number of valid rows.
- [ ] AC-10: The parser handles 10 rows, 800k rows, and partial last chunks identically. Memory usage stays bounded (streaming + bulk-create per 1000) regardless of file size.
- [ ] AC-11: Re-uploading the same ASIN within a different batch creates a second target row, but at scrape time the wrapper consults `AmazonProduct(asin, marketplace).updated_at`: if updated within the last `cfg.fresh_skip_days` (default 30) **and** the upload was submitted without the `force_rescrape` checkbox, the target is marked `active=False` with `last_error='skipped_fresh'` and counted as `done` (not `failed`). With `force_rescrape=True` on upload, freshness is bypassed for the entire batch. Duplicate ASINs **inside the same upload file** are deduplicated (latest row wins); the duplicate count is recorded in `batch.errors`.
- [ ] AC-11b: `BulkScrapeBatch` gains a boolean field `force_rescrape` (default False), set from the upload form checkbox "Re-scrape even if product was updated within last 30 days". `ScraperConfig` gains `fresh_skip_days` (PositiveInteger, default 30, admin-editable).

### Drainer / Throttle Loop
- [ ] AC-12: New django-rq task `drain_bulk_batch(batch_id)` is the heart of the throttle. Loop:
    1. Re-load `ScraperConfig` and `BulkScrapeBatch` from DB.
    2. If `batch.status != RUNNING`: exit.
    3. `max_in_flight = floor(cfg.concurrent_requests / cfg.batch_size)`. **No minimum** — see EC-13 (soft pause via `concurrent_requests=0` must work).
    4. `global_in_flight = ScrapeJob.objects.filter(status__in=[PENDING, RUNNING], mode=BATCH_ASIN).count()` — global pool across **all** batches.
    5. `slots_free = max_in_flight − global_in_flight`.
    6. If `slots_free > 0`: pick the next `slots_free × cfg.batch_size` `ScheduledScrapeTarget` rows from this batch where `active=False` and `last_error IS NULL` (or `retry_count < cfg.max_retries_per_asin`), chunk into groups of `cfg.batch_size`, create one `ScrapeJob` per chunk (`mode=BATCH_ASIN`, `asin_list=[...]`, `batch=B`, `marketplace=...`), and enqueue `scrape_asin_batch_job(scrape_job_id)` onto the `scraper` queue. Set the picked targets `active=True`.
    7. Update `batch.pending_count` / `running_count` / `done_count` / `failed_count` from a single aggregation query.
    8. If `count(targets in batch where active=False AND last_error IS NULL AND retry_count < max) == 0` AND `count(ScrapeJob in this batch where status IN [PENDING, RUNNING]) == 0`: set `batch.status=COMPLETED`, `finished_at=now`, exit.
    9. Re-enqueue self via `django_rq.get_queue('default').enqueue_in(timedelta(seconds=10), drain_bulk_batch, batch_id)` then return. The `default` queue worker is freed between ticks rather than held captive by `time.sleep`. Functionally equivalent: drainer fires every 10 s while batch.status=RUNNING. (See Tech Design "self-rescheduling drainer" rationale.)
- [ ] AC-13: Drainer is idempotent. A Redis lock keyed `bulk_drainer:<batch_id>` is acquired with `SET NX EX 60` and refreshed every iteration. If the worker dies, the lock expires and a new drainer can take over without enqueuing duplicate work (target-`active` flag + DB in-flight counts make the operation safe to repeat).
- [ ] AC-14: Concurrency-limit changes propagate within one tick (≤10 s). Mid-run change from 50 → 25 (with `batch_size=10`) reduces `max_in_flight` from 5 → 2 on the next tick. Already-running spider processes finish; no new ones are enqueued until in-flight drops below the new limit. No data loss, no duplicate scrapes.
- [ ] AC-15: Multiple batches in `RUNNING` state simultaneously share the same global slot pool. Each batch has its own drainer; they do not coordinate; the FIFO behavior of the `scraper` queue determines fairness.

### Batch Spider
- [ ] AC-16: New Scrapy spider `amazon_product_batch` accepts argument `asins` (comma-separated) and `marketplace`. It generates one request per ASIN to `https://<base>/dp/<asin>/`, identical request setup as the existing `amazon_product` spider (UA, ScraperOps middleware, headers).
- [ ] AC-17: The spider runs internally with `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN={cfg.batch_size}` so all ASINs in the batch are fetched in parallel.
- [ ] AC-18: The spider reuses the existing detail-page `parse_*` callbacks and item pipelines from `amazon_product`. Each parsed item is persisted as `AmazonProduct` exactly as today.
- [ ] AC-19: Per-ASIN outcome (OK / FAILED + error message) is written by the spider to a JSON results file at `/tmp/scrape_batch_<scrape_job_id>.json` (one entry per ASIN: `{asin, status: 'ok'|'failed', error_message, http_status, scraped_at}`). The wrapper reads this file after subprocess exit, then deletes it. Format: a single JSON object `{"results": [...]}`. Spider writes incrementally (append-after-each-item via item_scraped_signal) so a partial crash still leaves a parseable file with whatever completed.

### Job Wrapper
- [ ] AC-20: New django-rq task `scrape_asin_batch_job(scrape_job_id)` runs in the `scraper` queue. It:
    1. Marks `ScrapeJob.status=RUNNING`, `started_at=now`.
    2. Spawns the `amazon_product_batch` Scrapy subprocess with `-a asins=<comma-list>` and concurrency settings injected from `ScraperConfig` (reusing existing `_scrapy_concurrency_settings()` pattern).
    3. On subprocess exit, parses per-ASIN outcomes; for each successful ASIN, the linked `ScheduledScrapeTarget` is set `active=False`, `last_scraped_at=now` (OneShot semantics — does NOT recalculate `next_scrape_at`).
    4. For each failed ASIN: increment `target.retry_count`. If `retry_count < cfg.max_retries_per_asin`: leave `active=False` and clear `last_error` so the drainer picks it up again. If `retry_count >= max`: set `active=False`, `last_error=<error>` permanently — drainer skips it.
    5. Marks `ScrapeJob.status=COMPLETED` (if all OK) or `FAILED` (if at least one ASIN failed and no retries remain) or `COMPLETED` with partial-fail summary in `error_log`. Final state up to architecture; the requirement is that the batch counts can be reconciled.
- [ ] AC-21: `ScheduledScrapeTarget.save()` is extended: when `tier.name == 'OneShot'` and `last_scraped_at` is set, `next_scrape_at` is **not** auto-recalculated (the model leaves it untouched or sets to `null`-equivalent). The `active=False` flag is the canonical "done" signal.

### Admin UI (2-Click Start, Pause/Resume/Cancel/Retry)
- [ ] AC-22: `BulkScrapeBatchAdmin` registered. Changelist columns: `name`, `marketplace`, `status` (badge), `total_count`, `pending_count`, `running_count`, `done_count`, `failed_count`, `created_at`, `started_at`. Filters: `status`, `marketplace`. Default ordering: `-created_at`.
- [ ] AC-23: Detail page shows: all fields, percentage progress bar (`done / total`), "Recent errors" panel (last 20 from `errors` JSON), and 5 action buttons rendered conditionally on `status`:
    - `Start` (visible when `status=READY` or `PAUSED`) — sets `status=RUNNING`, enqueues `drain_bulk_batch(batch_id)` if not already locked.
    - `Pause` (visible when `status=RUNNING`) — sets `status=PAUSED`. Drainer detects on next tick and exits. In-flight ScrapeJobs are NOT cancelled; they finish normally.
    - `Resume` (visible when `status=PAUSED`) — same as Start.
    - `Cancel` (visible when `status` in {`READY`, `RUNNING`, `PAUSED`}) — sets `status=CANCELLED`, removes any pending RQ jobs for this batch from the `scraper` queue, lets running ones finish.
    - `Retry Failed` (visible when `status` in {`COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`}) — strict semantics: clears `last_error` and `retry_count` **only** on `ScheduledScrapeTarget` rows in this batch where `last_error IS NOT NULL`. Targets that were skipped (`last_error='skipped_fresh'`), already done, or never tried are NOT touched. Then transitions `status=RUNNING` and enqueues a new drainer. To re-process never-tried targets after a Cancel, use `Resume` (which is the same `Start` action on a CANCELLED batch — implementation may rename to "Resume" when status=CANCELLED).
- [ ] AC-24: 2-click start UX from a fresh upload: (1) click the batch row in the changelist → batch detail page opens, (2) click `Start` → drainer running. No bulk-edit on 100k targets is required from the admin.
- [ ] AC-25: All admin actions require `IsStaff`. Each action records an `errors[]` entry tagged `{action: "...", user: "...", at: "..."}` for audit history.
- [ ] AC-26: Manual delete of a `BulkScrapeBatch` cascades to `ScheduledScrapeTarget` (FK CASCADE) but leaves `ScrapeJob` rows in place (`SET_NULL`) so the scrape audit trail is preserved.

### Worker Scaling
- [ ] AC-27: `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml` declare `worker-scraper` with `deploy.replicas: ${BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS:-5}`. Verified compatible with Compose v5.1.3 on production (Strato VC 8-32, 212.132.102.96, checked 2026-05-05). `container_name` is removed from the worker-scraper service since named containers conflict with replicas.
- [ ] AC-28: `BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS` is documented in `.env.template` with a default of `5` and a comment about RAM cost (`~1-2 GB per replica including Scrapy subprocess`).
- [ ] AC-29: With 5 replicas + `cfg.batch_size=10` + `cfg.concurrent_requests=50`, end-to-end live test on the production `scraper` queue achieves ≥45 simultaneous HTTP requests sustained (verified via ScraperOps dashboard) for at least 60 seconds during the first 1k-ASIN test batch.

### Observability
- [ ] AC-30: Drainer logs every tick at INFO level: `"drainer batch=<id> in_flight=<n> max=<n> enqueued=<n> remaining=<n>"`. WARNING level on lock contention or RQ enqueue exceptions.
- [ ] AC-31: `BulkScrapeBatch` counts (`pending_count`, `running_count`, `done_count`, `failed_count`) reflect DB reality within one drainer tick (≤10 s). They are computed via aggregation, not maintained incrementally, so they self-correct after a drainer restart or partial-failure scenario.
- [ ] AC-32: A `Recent errors` JSON list on the batch tracks the last 100 events of: parse errors, drainer enqueue failures, RQ job exceptions surfaced through the wrapper, and admin actions. Older entries are truncated FIFO.

## Edge Cases
- [ ] EC-1: 800k-row upload — parser memory stays under 200 MB and full-file parse completes within 5 minutes on the production server. No browser-side timeout (background job).
- [ ] EC-2: 7-row upload — last (and only) batch contains 7 ASINs; spider runs with 7 parallel requests; batch completes in seconds. No special-casing required for partial last chunk.
- [ ] EC-3: Mid-run admin changes `ScraperConfig.concurrent_requests` from 50 to 25 — drainer adjusts within 10 s; in-flight jobs finish; no new enqueue until in-flight ≤ 2; no duplicate scrapes; no orphaned targets.
- [ ] EC-4: Mid-run admin changes `ScraperConfig.batch_size` from 10 to 5 — already-enqueued ScrapeJobs (with 10-ASIN lists) finish as-is; new ScrapeJobs created by the drainer use the new batch_size of 5. Both formats coexist; the spider handles both based on the actual `asin_list` it receives.
- [ ] EC-5: ScraperOps quota exhausted during a 100k batch — individual ASIN requests start failing with HTTP 429 / 5xx; spider records per-ASIN error; `scrape_asin_batch_job` increments `retry_count`; drainer re-enqueues failed targets up to `max_retries_per_asin`; permanent failures land in `last_error`; batch eventually reaches `COMPLETED` with `failed_count > 0`.
- [ ] EC-6: Drainer worker process crashes mid-run — Redis lock expires after 60 s; admin clicks `Resume` (or another drainer is enqueued automatically by a future heartbeat mechanism — implementation detail) and the new drainer reads in-flight from DB, picks up where the previous left off, no duplicates because already-active targets are skipped.
- [ ] EC-7: Two batches in `RUNNING` simultaneously, each with 50k targets — global slot pool of 5 means both share throughput. Drainer A enqueues 3 jobs; drainer B (next tick) sees only 2 slots free; enqueues 2 jobs. Both batches progress, neither starves catastrophically (no priority — FIFO).
- [ ] EC-8: User clicks `Cancel` while 5 batch jobs are in-flight — `status=CANCELLED`, drainer exits next tick, the 5 in-flight subprocesses run to completion, their results are still persisted (saved AmazonProduct rows), corresponding targets become `active=False`. RQ pending jobs (none, since drainer never enqueues more than max_in_flight) are scrubbed from the queue.
- [ ] EC-9: User clicks `Retry Failed` after a batch reaches `COMPLETED` with `failed_count=42` — 42 targets have their `last_error=NULL`, `retry_count=0`, `active=False`; `batch.status=RUNNING`; new drainer enqueued; only those 42 targets are processed; batch transitions back to `COMPLETED` when done.
- [ ] EC-10: Same ASIN appears in batch A AND batch B — independent `ScheduledScrapeTarget` rows are created (one per `(asin, marketplace, batch)` combination). With `force_rescrape=False` (default) on batch B and the AmazonProduct freshly scraped by batch A within `fresh_skip_days`, batch B's target is skipped (counted as `done`, last_error=`skipped_fresh`). With `force_rescrape=True`, batch B re-scrapes regardless.
- [ ] EC-10b: `force_rescrape=True` overrides freshness for **all** targets in that batch — including ones never scraped before (no-op, those would be scraped anyway).
- [ ] EC-10c: Batch parser sees a row whose ASIN already has an `AmazonProduct.updated_at < 30d` but the user uploaded with `force_rescrape=False` — the target is **still inserted** with `active=False`. The skip decision is made at scrape-time by the wrapper, NOT at parse-time, so the user can change `fresh_skip_days` between upload and start.
- [ ] EC-11: Admin uploads a malformed XLSX (corrupt zip, missing `xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml`) — `parse_bulk_upload_job` catches the exception, sets `batch.status=PARSE_FAILED`, writes the exception message to `batch.errors`. No half-created targets remain (parser does atomic per-chunk transaction OR rolls back on any chunk failure — implementation detail).
- [ ] EC-12: Admin uploads a CSV with a `marketplace` column whose value is `amazon_pl` (not in `MarketplaceChoices`) — affected rows skipped, error count + first 100 lines in `batch.errors`, valid rows still ingested.
- [ ] EC-13: `ScraperConfig.concurrent_requests=0` — `max_in_flight = max(0, floor(0/10)) = 0`; drainer enqueues nothing, batch effectively paused without an explicit `Pause`. Documented as the "soft pause via config" trick.
- [ ] EC-14: `worker-scraper` replicas = 0 — drainer enqueues to RQ, jobs sit pending forever, no ASINs scraped. Drainer keeps trying every 10 s. Admin recovers by scaling replicas back up; pending jobs drain normally.
- [ ] EC-15: Adding the `OneShot` tier on a fresh DB — the seed migration creates it; if the admin had already created one manually with a different `interval_days`, the seed leaves it alone (look up by `name`).
- [ ] EC-16: Snapshot of in-flight batches if Postgres is restarted — `ScrapeJob` rows persist; on worker restart, the `scrape_asin_batch_job` may find its own row already marked `RUNNING`; the wrapper must detect orphaned-RUNNING jobs at startup and either resume or re-mark `FAILED` based on subprocess exit. (Implementation detail; the requirement is "no zombie jobs forever".)
- [ ] EC-17: Disk full during `bulk_uploads/` write — upload form returns a clear error message; no `BulkScrapeBatch` row created; admin sees a 500 page with cause.

## Resolved Open Questions (2026-05-05)
- **Q1 — Per-ASIN outcome reporting:** **A** — JSON file `/tmp/scrape_batch_<job_id>.json`, wrapper reads on subprocess exit then deletes (AC-19).
- **Q2 — Compose replicas:** **A** — `deploy.replicas: ${BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS:-5}` (verified Compose v5.1.3 on prod, AC-27).
- **Q3 — Re-scrape behavior:** **B** — Skip when AmazonProduct fresh < `fresh_skip_days` (default 30); upload form has `force_rescrape` checkbox to bypass (AC-11, AC-11b, EC-10/10b/10c).
- **Q4 — Retry Failed semantics:** **A** — Only re-activates targets where `last_error IS NOT NULL`; never-tried use `Resume` instead (AC-23).

## Out of Scope (deferred)
- Frontend (non-admin) UI — this is admin-only for v1; a customer-facing batch UI is post-MVP if ever needed.
- ETA prediction in the admin (e.g. "completes at 2026-05-08 14:00") — not in v1; a simple progress bar is enough.
- Per-batch concurrency override — all batches share the global `ScraperConfig`. If two batches want different priority, that is a v2 feature.
- Round-robin / weighted scheduling between multiple `RUNNING` batches — v1 is FIFO via the `scraper` RQ queue.
- Auto-retry beyond `max_retries_per_asin` (e.g. exponential backoff hours later) — v1 retries once immediately, then permanent fail.
- Alerts on batch failure (Slack / email) — observability is admin UI only.
- Streaming progress via WebSocket — admin page polls or refreshes manually.
- Soft-cancel of a running spider subprocess (sending SIGTERM mid-batch and persisting partial results) — v1 lets in-flight finish on Cancel.

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - Upload of 800k-row XLSX returns the browser to the batch detail page within 1 s; full parse completes within 5 min.
  - Drainer tick latency ≤ 100 ms when there is work to enqueue (DB queries + RQ enqueue).
  - Live concurrency-limit change visible in throughput within 10 s.
  - Sustained ≥45 simultaneous HTTP requests with `concurrent_requests=50, batch_size=10, replicas=5`.
- **Resource ceilings:**
  - Redis pending-job count globally ≤ `max_in_flight + small constant` (typically <20) — the queue is never used as long-term storage.
  - Each `worker-scraper` replica peak ≈ 1.5 GB RAM (Python + Scrapy subprocess at full concurrency). 5 replicas ≤ 8 GB.
  - Parser RAM: bounded streaming + bulk-create batch of 1000 → < 200 MB even on 800k file.
- **Live tunability:** `concurrent_requests`, `concurrent_requests_per_domain`, `download_delay_ms`, `batch_size`, `max_retries_per_asin` are all admin-editable on `ScraperConfig` and take effect within one drainer tick.
- **Configurability:** `BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS` env var sets replica count; default 5; documented in `.env.template`.
- **Reliability:** Drainer is idempotent (Redis lock + DB-derived in-flight count). Worker crash + restart leaves no zombies and no duplicates.
- **Security:** Admin-only (`IsStaff`). Uploaded files saved under `MEDIA_ROOT/bulk_uploads/<uuid>` to avoid path collisions; no user-controlled filename written to disk.
- **Database:** No new app — all changes inside `scraper_app`. Migrations are additive (new model, new fields, new tier seed). No schema changes to `AmazonProduct`.

## Tech Design (Solution Architect)

### Approach
Lives entirely inside the existing `scraper_app` — no new Django app, no new infrastructure. Reuses the production Scrapy machinery (`ProductDetailMixin`, ScraperOps middleware, item pipelines, selectors), the existing `scraper` and `default` django-rq queues, the existing `ScraperConfig` singleton (extended with three new fields), and the existing admin CSV/XLSX parser (`_parse_uploaded_file` in `admin.py`, lifted to a new `scraper_app/parsers.py` module so it can be imported by the async parser job without a circular admin import). One new model (`BulkScrapeBatch`), one new spider (`amazon_product_batch`), three new django-rq tasks (`parse_bulk_upload_job`, `scrape_asin_batch_job`, `drain_bulk_batch`), one new admin (`BulkScrapeBatchAdmin`), and the `worker-scraper` compose service is converted from a single named container to a replica set driven by `BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS`.

The architectural innovation is the **self-rescheduling drainer**: rather than holding a worker captive with `time.sleep(10)`, `drain_bulk_batch` does one tick of work and re-enqueues itself onto the `default` queue with `enqueue_in(timedelta(seconds=10))`. This frees the worker between ticks, keeps Redis-lock semantics simple (lock TTL = 60 s heartbeat), and lets `default` queue workers serve other jobs (parser, scheduler) without being blocked.

### Data Model (plain language)

**`BulkScrapeBatch`** — one row per upload.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | UUID | primary key |
| name | text | admin-supplied label |
| source_filename | text | original uploaded filename |
| marketplace | choice | from `MarketplaceChoices`, batch default |
| force_rescrape | bool | default False; if True, freshness-skip (Q3) is bypassed for this batch |
| status | choice | DRAFT / PARSING / PARSE_FAILED / READY / RUNNING / PAUSED / COMPLETED / CANCELLED |
| total_count, pending_count, running_count, done_count, failed_count | int | aggregation cache, refreshed every drainer tick |
| errors | JSON list | last 100 events (parse warnings, drainer enqueue failures, admin actions) |
| created_by | FK User, nullable | who uploaded |
| created_at, started_at, finished_at | datetime, nullable | lifecycle stamps |

**`ScheduledScrapeTarget` additions** (existing model, Phase B/D):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| batch | FK → BulkScrapeBatch (nullable, CASCADE) | null for legacy non-batch targets |
| last_error | text, nullable | `'skipped_fresh'` for freshness skip; otherwise the most recent failure message |
| retry_count | PositiveInt, default 0 | incremented on each failed attempt; capped by `cfg.max_retries_per_asin` |

**`ScrapeJob` additions**:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `Mode.BATCH_ASIN` | new choice | added to existing `Mode` TextChoices |
| asin_list | JSONField list, nullable | up to `cfg.batch_size` ASINs (validator); only set when mode=BATCH_ASIN |
| batch | FK → BulkScrapeBatch (nullable, SET_NULL) | preserves audit trail when batch is deleted |

**`ScraperConfig` additions** (existing singleton):

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| batch_size | PositiveInt (1–50) | 10 | ASINs per batch spider subprocess; live-tunable |
| max_retries_per_asin | PositiveInt | 1 | how many times a failed ASIN is auto-retried in the same batch |
| fresh_skip_days | PositiveInt | 30 | skip if `AmazonProduct.updated_at` is fresher than this |

**`ScrapeTier` (data, no schema change)** — Phase A migration seeds:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| name | `OneShot` |
| bsr_min | 0 |
| bsr_max | NULL |
| interval_days | 999999 |

The `OneShot` semantics are encoded by **string-matching `tier.name`** in `ScheduledScrapeTarget.save()` (avoid adding a `BooleanField`-style schema change since the user already created this tier manually with name='OneShot'; the seed is idempotent).

### Workflow Sequence — Upload → Parse

```
Admin → POST /admin/scraper_app/bulkscrapebatch/upload/
  ├─ Save uploaded file to MEDIA_ROOT/bulk_uploads/<batch_uuid>.<ext>
  ├─ Create BulkScrapeBatch row (status=PARSING, total_count=0, errors=[])
  ├─ Enqueue parse_bulk_upload_job(batch_id) on 'default' queue
  └─ Redirect → /admin/scraper_app/bulkscrapebatch/<id>/change/  (within 1 s)

[default queue worker]
parse_bulk_upload_job(batch_id):
  ├─ Load batch + file
  ├─ parsers._parse_uploaded_file(file)  → stream rows
  ├─ Per chunk of 1000:
  │   ├─ Validate (asin regex, marketplace choice, dedupe within file)
  │   ├─ Append invalid rows to batch.errors (cap 100)
  │   └─ ScheduledScrapeTarget.objects.bulk_create([...], ignore_conflicts=True, batch_size=1000)
  ├─ Update batch.total_count = valid rows
  ├─ batch.status = READY (or PARSE_FAILED if zero valid rows / file unreadable)
  └─ Delete uploaded file (clean up MEDIA_ROOT/bulk_uploads/)
```

### Workflow Sequence — Start → Drainer Loop (self-rescheduling)

```
Admin clicks "Start" on batch detail page:
  ├─ Validate batch.status ∈ {READY, PAUSED}
  ├─ batch.status = RUNNING, started_at=now
  ├─ Append errors entry {action: 'start', user, at}
  └─ Enqueue drain_bulk_batch(batch_id) on 'default' queue (immediately)

[default queue worker — one tick at a time]
drain_bulk_batch(batch_id):
  ├─ Acquire Redis lock 'bulk_drainer:<batch_id>' SET NX EX 60
  │   └─ if already locked: log INFO, exit (the prior tick is still running)
  ├─ Reload batch + ScraperConfig from DB
  ├─ if batch.status != RUNNING: release lock, exit
  ├─ max_in_flight  = max(1, floor(cfg.concurrent_requests / cfg.batch_size))
  ├─ global_in_flight = ScrapeJob.objects.filter(status∈[PENDING,RUNNING], mode=BATCH_ASIN).count()
  ├─ slots_free      = max_in_flight − global_in_flight
  ├─ if slots_free > 0:
  │   ├─ Pick (slots_free × cfg.batch_size) targets where batch=B AND active=False AND
  │   │   (last_error IS NULL OR retry_count < cfg.max_retries_per_asin)
  │   │   AND last_error != 'skipped_fresh', ordered by id
  │   ├─ For each chunk of cfg.batch_size:
  │   │   ├─ Create ScrapeJob(mode=BATCH_ASIN, asin_list=[...], batch=B, marketplace, status=PENDING)
  │   │   ├─ Mark targets.active=True (linked to ScrapeJob via target.scrape_job FK or just the ASIN match)
  │   │   └─ rq_scraper.enqueue(scrape_asin_batch_job, scrape_job.id)
  │   └─ Append errors entry on enqueue exceptions
  ├─ Refresh batch.{pending,running,done,failed}_count via aggregation
  ├─ if no remaining work AND no in-flight in this batch:
  │   ├─ batch.status = COMPLETED, finished_at=now
  │   ├─ release lock, exit
  └─ rq_default.enqueue_in(timedelta(seconds=10), drain_bulk_batch, batch_id)
     └─ release lock (next tick re-acquires)
```

**Why self-rescheduling instead of `while True: sleep(10)`** — see Tech Decisions table below.

### Workflow Sequence — Per-Batch Spider Run

```
[scraper queue worker]
scrape_asin_batch_job(scrape_job_id):
  ├─ Load ScrapeJob; if status==RUNNING already: zombie detection (EC-16)
  │   └─ Mark FAILED, log WARNING, return
  ├─ ScrapeJob.status=RUNNING, started_at=now, pid=proc.pid
  ├─ Build subprocess cmd:
  │   scrapy crawl amazon_product_batch
  │     -a asins=B077…,B078…,…
  │     -a marketplace=amazon_com
  │     -a job_id=<scrape_job_id>
  │     -s CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=<cfg>
  │     -s CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN=<cfg.batch_size>
  │     -s DOWNLOAD_DELAY=<cfg.download_delay_ms/1000>
  ├─ proc.communicate()  (blocking, but the wrapper is on scraper queue, fine)
  ├─ Read /tmp/scrape_batch_<scrape_job_id>.json:
  │   { "results": [
  │       {"asin":"B077…","status":"ok","scraped_at":"…"},
  │       {"asin":"B078…","status":"failed","error_message":"HTTP 503","http_status":503,"scraped_at":"…"},
  │       …
  │   ]}
  ├─ For each result.ok:
  │   └─ ScheduledScrapeTarget(batch=B, asin=…).update(active=False, last_scraped_at=now, last_error=NULL)
  ├─ For each result.failed:
  │   ├─ target.retry_count += 1
  │   ├─ if retry_count < cfg.max_retries_per_asin: active=False, last_error=NULL  (drainer retries)
  │   └─ else: active=False, last_error=<msg>  (terminal)
  ├─ Compute ScrapeJob status:
  │   - all results ok        → status=COMPLETED, error_log=''
  │   - mixed                  → status=COMPLETED with summary in error_log
  │   - subprocess crashed     → status=FAILED, all targets get retry_count+=1
  ├─ Delete /tmp/scrape_batch_<scrape_job_id>.json
  └─ Return (drainer's next tick aggregates new counts)
```

### Workflow Sequence — Pause / Resume / Cancel / Retry-Failed

```
Pause   (status=RUNNING → PAUSED):
  ├─ batch.status=PAUSED, append errors entry
  └─ Drainer detects on next tick (≤10 s) and exits cleanly
     In-flight ScrapeJobs run to completion; results still applied.

Resume  (status=PAUSED → RUNNING) — same code path as Start.

Cancel  (status ∈ {READY,RUNNING,PAUSED} → CANCELLED):
  ├─ batch.status=CANCELLED, finished_at=now
  ├─ Scrub pending RQ jobs whose scrape_job.batch_id=B from 'scraper' queue
  │   (iterate queue.get_jobs() and queue.remove() for matching ones — bounded N)
  ├─ Running spider subprocesses are NOT signalled; they finish, their writes apply
  └─ Drainer exits next tick

Retry Failed  (status ∈ {COMPLETED,CANCELLED} → RUNNING):
  ├─ Q4=A strict semantics:
  │   ScheduledScrapeTarget.objects.filter(batch=B, last_error__isnull=False)
  │     .exclude(last_error='skipped_fresh')
  │     .update(last_error=None, retry_count=0)
  ├─ batch.status=RUNNING, finished_at=NULL, append errors entry
  └─ Enqueue drain_bulk_batch(B) again (drainer skips already-done targets)
```

### Tech Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Self-rescheduling drainer (`enqueue_in(10s)`) instead of `while True: sleep(10)` | A long-running task pinning a `default` queue worker for hours/days would block the parser job (Phase B), the existing `schedule_scrape_runner` (every hour), and the canary `schedule_health_check_runner`. Self-rescheduling keeps each tick under 100 ms and frees the worker between ticks. Cost: a tiny RQ enqueue per 10 s (~0.1 KB Redis). |
| Per-ASIN outcome via `/tmp/<job_id>.json` (Q1=A) | No new HTTP endpoint, no new auth surface, no Django callback round-trip. Spider writes incrementally via `item_scraped` signal so a partial crash is still parseable. Wrapper deletes the file on completion (no garbage). |
| Global slot pool (one `max_in_flight` across all batches) | User wanted "weniger Probleme". Per-batch slots would require priority/round-robin logic to prevent starvation. FIFO via the `scraper` queue is fair enough for the 800k seed use case. Trivially extensible to per-batch v2 if ever needed. |
| `force_rescrape` as a per-batch boolean (Q3=B) | Skip-decision must be late (at scrape time) so the user can change `fresh_skip_days` between upload and start. Per-batch boolean (vs per-row) keeps the upload form simple — the entire file shares one freshness intent. |
| OneShot encoded as `tier.name == 'OneShot'` string-match (vs new BooleanField) | The user already created this tier manually with `name='OneShot'`. A schema change to `ScrapeTier` would force a data migration to set the flag retroactively, with no benefit. Tier names are admin-controlled — if someone renames it, behavior changes intentionally. |
| `container_name` removed from `worker-scraper` for replicas | Compose enforces uniqueness of `container_name`; setting it to `app_worker_scraper` while requesting 5 replicas causes a startup error. Compose auto-names replicas (`merch-miner-worker-scraper-1` … `-5`), which is fine for logs. |
| `BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS` env var (Q2=A) | `deploy.replicas: ${BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS:-5}` works on Compose v5.1.3 (verified prod). Falls back to 5 if unset. Operator scales without code change. |
| `_parse_uploaded_file` moved to `scraper_app/parsers.py` | The async parser job (`parse_bulk_upload_job`) needs to import the parser. Importing from `admin.py` would force-load the admin module in a worker context (potentially loading Django admin templates). Lifting to `parsers.py` makes the dependency clean and lets `admin._process_asin_csv` (Phase A smoke-test path) keep using it. |
| Counts via aggregation (not incremental) | AC-31: counts must be self-correcting after a drainer crash. Maintaining counts incrementally requires distributed-counter discipline; an `aggregate(Count(...))` query every 10 s on indexed columns is cheap (microseconds for any plausible batch size). |
| Redis lock `SET NX EX 60` with heartbeat | The lock TTL (60 s) > drainer tick (10 s) + safety margin. If a tick takes > 60 s (shouldn't, but if Postgres hangs), a parallel tick may start — the in-flight DB count makes the work idempotent (already-active targets are skipped). |
| Zombie ScrapeJob detection at task entry (EC-16) | Cheaper than a startup hook. If the wrapper sees its own ScrapeJob in RUNNING state at task entry, the previous worker died mid-run; mark FAILED, return. Drainer retries via the target's `retry_count`. |
| Reuse `ProductDetailMixin` in `amazon_product_batch` | The detail-page parsing logic (selectors, item construction, item pipeline) is identical to single-ASIN scraping. Only `start_requests` differs (multiple URLs from comma-separated arg). Inheritance keeps the audit/maintenance surface to the mixin. |

### Migrations Strategy

5 migrations, all additive (no destructive operations on existing data):

| # | File | Type | Phase | Purpose |
|---|------|------|-------|---------|
| 0018 | `seed_oneshot_tier.py` | data | A | Idempotent `get_or_create(name='OneShot', defaults={bsr_min=0, bsr_max=None, interval_days=999999})`. Reverse migration is a no-op (don't auto-delete). |
| 0019 | `scraperconfig_batch_fields.py` | schema | D | Add `batch_size`, `max_retries_per_asin`, `fresh_skip_days` to `ScraperConfig`. All have defaults so the existing singleton row gets values automatically. |
| 0020 | `bulkscrapebatch.py` | schema | B | Create `BulkScrapeBatch` table + indexes (`status`, `created_at`). |
| 0021 | `target_batch_lasterror_retry.py` | schema | B | Add `batch` FK + `last_error` text + `retry_count` PositiveInt to `ScheduledScrapeTarget`. All nullable / default 0. Index on `(batch, active, last_error)` for the drainer's pick query. |
| 0022 | `scrapejob_batch_asinlist_mode.py` | schema | C | Add `BATCH_ASIN` to `Mode` choices, add `asin_list` JSON, add `batch` FK (SET_NULL) to `ScrapeJob`. Index on `(status, mode)` for the drainer's global-in-flight query. |

Migrations may be applied independently — Phase A → A's migration only, Phase B → B+C+D+E migrations together (or further split as discrete commits).

### Settings & Env

| Var | Default | Where | Purpose |
|-----|---------|-------|---------|
| `BACKEND_SCRAPER_WORKERS` | `5` | `.env.template`, `docker-compose*.yml` | replica count for `worker-scraper` service |

No new Django settings — all tunables live on `ScraperConfig` (admin-editable, live-reloaded by drainer every tick).

### Failure Modes & Observability Mapping

| Failure | Detected by | Recovery | Observability |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Drainer worker crashes mid-tick | Redis lock TTL expires after 60 s | Next `enqueue_in` tick (or admin `Resume`) acquires lock, reads in-flight from DB, picks up | Lock-acquire log; gap in tick log |
| RQ `default` queue stalled (no worker) | Drainer never re-fires | Admin scales workers; on next tick, `enqueue_in` lands | RQ admin shows queue depth growing |
| ScraperOps quota exhausted | Spider records 429/5xx per ASIN; wrapper tags `last_error='HTTP 429'` | After `max_retries_per_asin`, target is terminal-failed; `failed_count` rises in batch | Drainer log `failed=N`; ScraperOps dashboard correlates |
| DB transient error during target update | Wrapper retry within Django ORM `transaction.atomic` block; if persistent, ScrapeJob FAILED | Drainer's next tick re-aggregates from authoritative DB state | RQ failed-jobs registry; ScrapeJob.error_log |
| Parse failure (corrupt XLSX) | `parse_bulk_upload_job` exception handler | `batch.status=PARSE_FAILED`, `errors[]` populated; admin-visible | Batch detail page; RQ failed-jobs |
| Disk full during upload | Django `FileField` raises during request | 500 page; no batch row created | Server logs |
| Zombie ScrapeJob (worker SIGKILLed) | Wrapper detects own row in RUNNING at entry | Mark FAILED, drainer retries via `retry_count` | ScrapeJob.error_log marker |
| `concurrent_requests=0` (soft pause) | Drainer sees `slots_free=0` every tick | Set back to >0 in admin; immediately resumes | Drainer log shows `enqueued=0 remaining=N` continuously |

### Dependencies on Existing Code

**Reused as-is** (no changes):
- `scraper_app.scrapy_app.spiders.mixins.ProductDetailMixin` — inherited by `amazon_product_batch`
- `scraper_app.selectors.get_base_url` — URL construction
- ScraperOps middleware + scrapy settings — concurrency comes from `_scrapy_concurrency_settings()`
- `scraper_app.tasks._scrapy_concurrency_settings()` — used by both wrappers
- `scraper_app.tasks._scrapy_env()` — subprocess env vars
- `scraper_app.tasks.scrape_asin_detail_job` — untouched, remains the single-ASIN path for the existing rescrape API

**Modified**:
- `scraper_app.models.ScheduledScrapeTarget.save()` — add OneShot branch (Phase A)
- `scraper_app.models.ScrapeJob.Mode` — add `BATCH_ASIN` choice (Phase C)
- `scraper_app.admin.py::_parse_uploaded_file` — moved to `scraper_app.parsers` (Phase B)
- `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml` — `worker-scraper` becomes replica set (Phase F)

**No frontend impact** — admin-only feature. No `frontend-ui/` changes.
