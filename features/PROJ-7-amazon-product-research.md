# PROJ-7: Amazon Product Research

**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** P0 (MVP)
**Created:** 2026-02-27
**Updated:** 2026-03-29

## Overview

A dedicated research page (inspired by MerchMatrix / Flying Research) for searching and filtering Amazon products before committing to a niche. Two modes: **Live Research** (triggers a fresh scrape via PROJ-16, fewer filters, real-time data) and **DB Research** (queries stored products with full filters and full-text search). All filters applied server-side. Scrape engine provided by PROJ-16.

## User Stories

1. As a member, I want to type a keyword and see Amazon autocomplete suggestions, so that I discover related search terms.
2. As a member, I want to switch between Live Research (fresh scrape) and DB Research (existing data), so that I can choose between speed and depth.
3. As a member, I want to filter products by BSR range, rating, reviews, price, and product type in DB Research mode, so that I find the sweet spot for niche viability.
4. As a member, I want to search across product title, brand, bullets, and description in DB Research mode, so that I find relevant products even if the keyword isn't the main title.
5. As a member, I want to see a full BSR history chart with trend indicators for a product, so that I can evaluate rank direction over time.
6. As a member, I want to click "Open on Amazon" to see live search results, so that I can verify the data.
7. As a member, I want to hide official brand products, so that I only see POD-eligible opportunities.
8. As a member, I want to click a product and add its keyword as a Niche, so that the research pipeline is connected.
9. As a member, I want to toggle between table and card view, so that I can switch between dense data comparison and visual browsing.
10. As a member, I want my recent searches saved as chips, so that I can quickly repeat common research queries.
11. As a member, I want to export the current filtered results to CSV, so that I can analyse or share data offline.
12. As a member, I want to click a product card and open a dedicated detail page (not inline), so that I can deeply analyze a single product without losing my search context.
13. As a member, I want to see extracted keywords from a product's listing on its detail page, so that I can identify high-value keywords and save them to my Keyword Bank.
14. As a member, I want to use a competitor's listing as a template for my own, so that I can quickly draft listings based on proven copy.
15. As a member, I want a statistics/keywords overview of my current search results, so that I can spot keyword frequency and overlap patterns before committing to a niche.
16. As a member, I want product cards to show a clean design-focused image with hover actions, so that I can quickly scan designs and act without clutter.
17. As a member, I want DB Research results to load progressively as I scroll (first 100, then 50 more each time) with virtualized rendering, so that I can browse thousands of products without lag or memory issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1 — Core Research (existing, QA passed 2026-03-23)

- [x] AC-1: Search input shows Amazon suggestions via proxy endpoint; debounced 300ms; max 10 suggestions shown.
- [x] AC-2: **Live Research mode:** Submitting a search triggers a fresh scrape via PROJ-16 if no completed result exists for that keyword+marketplace within 24h. Returns a job reference for the user to track progress via polling.
- [x] AC-3: **DB Research mode:** `GET /api/research/products/` returns all stored products matching the keyword via full-text search across title, brand, bullets, description; full filter set applied server-side.
- [x] AC-4: Mode toggle (Live / DB) is prominent in the UI; switching modes re-fetches data with the appropriate endpoint.
- [x] AC-5: **Layout toggle:** Grid / List toggle buttons in the results toolbar. Grid = product cards with thumbnail prominent. List = dense table view. Default: Grid.
- [x] AC-6: Results (List view) show per product: thumbnail, title, brand, BSR (color-coded badge), rating, reviews count, price, ASIN, listed date.
- [x] AC-7: **Advanced Options (DB Research):** Collapsible panel below the controls row. Range sliders for BSR, Reviews, Price — each with an enable/disable toggle switch. Star-click rating selector. Hide Official Brands toggle button. Subcategory, Exclude Words text inputs, Date Range pickers. In Live mode: panel dimmed, only Product Type + Hide Official Brands active. Applying filters re-fetches immediately.
- [x] AC-8: Sort controls change the result order; results re-fetch from server on sort change.
- [x] AC-9: "Open on Amazon" button opens `https://www.amazon.{marketplace}/s?k={keyword}` in new tab (pure frontend).
- [x] AC-10: "Add to Niche List" button creates a new Niche from the search keyword and shows a success notification.
- [x] AC-11: A progress indicator is shown while a Live Research scrape is in progress, including current page and product count.
- [x] AC-12: **Live Research error state:** If scrape fails, show error message and a "Retry" button that re-triggers the search.
- [x] AC-13: Autocomplete suggestions are server-side cached; repeated identical queries return instantly without hitting Amazon's API again.
- [x] AC-14: Live Research status can be polled by the UI until the scrape completes or fails.
- [x] AC-15: **Recent searches:** Last 10 unique (keyword + marketplace) pairs stored in `localStorage`. Displayed as clickable chips below the search input. Clicking a chip pre-fills the search and triggers the active mode's request. Persists across sessions per browser.
- [x] AC-16: **CSV export (DB Research):** "Export CSV" button downloads all products matching the current filters/sort (no pagination limit on export). Button is disabled when result count = 0.
- [x] AC-17: **Default marketplace:** `amazon_com` on page load. Selection persists to `localStorage` and is restored on next visit.

### Phase 2 — Bug Fixes (amendment 2026-03-28)

- [x] AC-18: **Search trigger:** Search only fires on Enter key press or Search button click.
- [x] AC-19: **Sort by:** Changing sort dropdown correctly re-fetches results in the selected order.
- [x] AC-20: **BSR display:** Product cards and table rows show the correct current BSR value.
- [x] AC-21: **Review count display:** Product cards show review count below the star rating.
- [x] AC-22: **Review filter:** Review range slider correctly filters products by `reviews_min`/`reviews_max`.
- [x] AC-23: **Bullets/Description layout:** Detail view renders bullets as list, description with "read more" truncation.
- [x] AC-24: **Listed date display:** Detail page shows listed date.

### Phase 3 — Product Card Redesign (amendment 2026-03-28)

- [x] AC-25: **Card image + sparkline:** 340px fixed height, BSR sparkline, design-cropped image.
- [x] AC-26: **Card hover overlay:** Copy ASIN, Open on Amazon, View details. `disableHover` prop for drawer. Download image removed. `hideHeart` prop for drawer. Touch fallback.
- [x] AC-27: **Card info layout:** BSR color-coded + price, stars + reviews, ASIN chip. No title/brand.
- [x] AC-28: **Card click → detail page:** Navigates to `/amazon/research/product/{asin}`.

### Phase 4 — Product Detail Page (amendment 2026-03-28)

> Design: Option B "Data Dashboard" — scrollable single page with KPI row, no tabs.

- [x] AC-29: **Detail page route:** Scrollable product dossier page with loading skeleton.
- [x] AC-30: **KPI row + content grid:** 4 KPI cards with visible icons (coral on alpha bg). Info chips with icons (Checkroom, Language, Calendar). Product type formatted (t_shirt → T Shirt).
- [x] AC-31: **Detail page actions row:** Open in Amazon, Use as Listing Template, Save Keywords.
- [x] AC-32: **BSR section:** LineChart 90 days. Subcategory ranks as split-tag design (category | BSR icon + mono-bold rank, tier color coded). Null-rank safe. BSR summary with trend icons.
- [x] AC-33: **Price history section:** Price line chart.
- [x] AC-34: **Keywords section:** Flying Research style — outlined chips with keyword + search icon, count below chip only when frequency > 1. Short-tail (cyan) + long-tail (info-blue). "Copy all keywords" button.
- [x] AC-35: **Competition section:** Similar Designs + Same Brand carousels. BSR icon instead of #, tier color coded. Click → navigate to detail page (null-rank crash fixed).
- [x] AC-36: **Use as Listing Template:** Button on detail page, POST mutation, notistack notification.

### Phase 5 — Statistics & Live Research UX (amendment 2026-03-28)

- [x] AC-37: **Statistics/Keywords view:** Products/Keywords toggle. Flying Research style keyword chips with count.
- [x] AC-38: **Live Research skeleton streaming:** Skeleton cards during scrape, progressive fill.
- [x] AC-39: **Double pagination fix:** Single pagination control.
- [x] AC-40: **Copy ASINs scope:** Label shows count.
- [x] AC-41: **CSV export filter consistency:** Uses `buildQueryParams()`.

### Phase 6 — Sort Selection, Product Types, Infinite Scroll, Cancel (amendment 2026-03-29)

#### Sort Selection
- [ ] AC-42: **Live Sort dropdown:** Visible in Live mode with Amazon sort options: Featured (default), Best Sellers, Newest, Price Low→High, Price High→Low, Avg Reviews, Relevance. MUI icons per option.
- [ ] AC-43: **DB Sort dropdown:** Unchanged — BSR, Reviews, Rating, Price, Newest. Both sort dropdowns visible simultaneously.
- [ ] AC-44: **Live sort default:** `featured-rank` pre-selected on page load.

#### Product Type Expansion (16 MBA Types)
- [ ] AC-45: **Product Type dropdown:** Expanded from 6 to 16 MBA types with custom SVG icons: T-Shirt, Premium Shirt, Comfort Colors, V-Neck, Long Sleeve, Raglan, Sweatshirt, Hoodie, Performance Polo, Zip Hoodie, PopSocket, Phone Case, Tote Bag, Tumbler, Ceramic Mug, Tank Top.
- [ ] AC-46: **`pullover` removed**, replaced by `sweatshirt` across frontend and backend.

#### Infinite Scroll (Live Mode)
- [ ] AC-47: **Page-by-page scraping:** Each live search job scrapes 1 Amazon page (`pages_total=1`). Products displayed when job completes.
- [ ] AC-48: **Scroll-triggered next page:** When user scrolls to bottom of product list AND previous job is completed → new job triggered with `start_page=N+1`. Products appended (deduplicated by ASIN).
- [ ] AC-49: **End of results:** If scrape returns 0 new products → infinite scroll stops.
- [ ] AC-50: **New keyword resets:** New search clears accumulated products and resets to page 1.

#### Cancel / Stop
- [ ] AC-51: **Search↔Stop toggle:** Search button becomes red "Stop" button (StopCircle icon) when live search is running. Clicking Stop cancels the backend job and resets UI to initial state.
- [ ] AC-52: **No error on cancel:** Cancelled searches show no error message. UI returns to clean state.

#### Skeleton Cards
- [ ] AC-53: **Skeleton progress:** During pending/running, skeleton cards (wave animation) shown below existing products instead of a loading bar. Max 8 skeletons. Count reduces as real products load.

#### Hardcoded Defaults
- [ ] AC-54: **Price range:** `price_min=13, price_max=100` sent to API automatically. Not exposed in UI.
- [ ] AC-55: **Browse node:** Auto-resolved from `PRODUCT_TYPE_BROWSE_NODES[product_type]`. Not exposed in UI.

#### Search Button UX
- [ ] AC-56: **Disabled when empty:** Search button disabled when keyword input is empty. Keeps primary color but darker/dimmed (0.5 opacity).

### Phase 7 — DB Search: Virtualized Infinite Scroll (amendment 2026-04-07)

- [ ] AC-57: **Initial load:** DB Research search returns first 100 products (`page_size=100, page=1`). No upfront full-count query.
- [ ] AC-58: **Scroll-triggered loading:** When user scrolls near bottom of product list → next page fetched with `page_size=50`. Products appended to existing list (deduplicated by ID).
- [ ] AC-59: **End detection:** If returned results count < `page_size` → no more pages. Scroll loading stops.
- [ ] AC-60: **Virtualized rendering:** Product card grid uses **`react-virtuoso`** (`<VirtuosoGrid>` component) to render only visible cards + buffer (`overscan` ~5 rows). DOM stays flat (~30 nodes regardless of total count) — RAM stays bounded, scroll stays at 60fps even with 10.000+ accumulated products. Library locked to Virtuoso (vs. TanStack Virtual): VirtuosoGrid is purpose-built for responsive card layouts, ~3x less wiring code, no manual `endReached`-trigger needed (built-in). Trade-off: ~20kB larger bundle than TanStack — acceptable for the dev-velocity gain on this and future virtualized lists. See ADR-002 (architecture-decisions.md) for the cross-cutting pattern.
- [ ] AC-61: **Loading indicator:** Skeleton cards (same style as Live mode) shown at bottom while next page loads. Removed once products arrive.
- [ ] AC-62: **Search reset:** New keyword search or filter change resets accumulated products, page counter, and scroll position.
- [ ] AC-63: **View mode compatible:** Virtualized scroll works in both Grid and List view modes. Grid view uses `<VirtuosoGrid>`. List view continues to use MUI `DataGrid` (which has built-in row virtualization) — only the `endReached`-equivalent (DataGrid's `onRowsScrollEnd` or scroll-listener) needs wiring to the same `loadNextPage()` from `useDbInfiniteScroll`. No double-virtualization.

#### Filter-Only Search (amendment 2026-05-01)
- [ ] AC-64: **DB mode without keyword:** In DB Research mode, the user MAY trigger a search with empty keyword field. Backend `/api/research/products/` already accepts requests without `keyword` param — frontend must allow submitting with no keyword.
- [ ] AC-64a: **Backend range-filter NULL handling:** Range filters (`bsr_min`/`max`, `reviews_min`/`max`, `price_min`/`max`) match products with NULL values for that field. Reason: 92% of T-shirts in DB have NULL `bsr` and NULL `reviews_count` — strict `.filter(bsr__gte=N)` excluded them silently when user enabled the filter at default full range, returning 0 results unexpectedly. Implemented as `Q(field__gte=N) | Q(field__isnull=True)`.
- [ ] AC-65: **Search button enable rule:** In DB mode, `Search` button is **always enabled** (keyword optional). In Live mode, keyword stays mandatory (Amazon scrape needs a search term). Marketplace + Product Type + Sort are always-sent params — sufficient as scope.
- [ ] AC-66: **Hook gate update:** `shouldQueryDb` simplifies to `!isLive && hasSearched` (drops `!!keyword`). The keyword is passed in the API params when present, omitted/empty otherwise.
- [ ] AC-67: **Empty-keyword UX:** Results header reads "X results (filter only)" when keyword is empty, or "X results for \"keyword\"" when keyword is set. `Copy ASINs` and CSV export work identically.
- [ ] EC-35: Empty-result set with no keyword → empty state reads "No products match your filters" instead of "No products found for this keyword". CTA "Adjust filters" or "Try Live Research".
- [ ] EC-36: User searches by keyword, then clears keyword field → next Enter / Search-click triggers a fresh page-1 fetch using whatever filters are active (`resetKey` includes empty keyword + filter state).

## Edge Cases

### Phase 1 (existing, QA passed)
- [x] EC-1: Amazon autocomplete returns empty → input works normally; no suggestions shown (no error).
- [x] EC-2: Live Research scrape returns 0 products → empty state: "No products found for this keyword."
- [x] EC-3: Scrape triggered while previous scrape for same keyword still running → return the in-progress job; no duplicate scrape started.
- [x] EC-4: `exclude_words` containing special characters → treated as plain text, not as patterns.
- [x] EC-5: Large result set (500+ products) → pagination 50/page; no client-side JS filtering.
- [x] EC-6: BSR `min` > `max` → 400 validation error.
- [x] EC-7: `hide_official_brands` list is maintained as a static fixture (not user-configurable in MVP).
- [x] EC-8: BSR history chart has < 2 data points → show single value with "Not enough history" label.
- [x] EC-9: DB Research with no stored products for keyword → empty state with suggestion to run Live Research.
- [x] EC-10: Live Research scrape status = `failed` → show error toast + inline error message with "Retry" button; retry re-triggers search with same params.
- [x] EC-11: Recent search chip clicked while scrape is in progress → previous polling cancelled; new request started.
- [x] EC-12: CSV export with 0 results → "Export CSV" button is disabled (no request sent).
- [x] EC-13: CSV export streams immediately; large sets (500+) handled without memory issues.
- [x] EC-14: localStorage recent searches exceed 10 entries → oldest entry is dropped (FIFO).
- [x] EC-15: User clears the search input → recent search chips remain visible as quick-start options.

### Phase 2-5 (amendment 2026-03-28)
- [ ] EC-16: Detail page for non-existent ASIN → 404 page with "Product not found" message and back link.
- [ ] EC-17: Detail page BSR history has 0 data points → show "No BSR data available" placeholder instead of empty chart.
- [ ] EC-18: Product has no thumbnail_url → show placeholder image on card and detail page.
- [ ] EC-19: "Use as Listing Template" with no active niche → show notistack warning "Select a niche first" or prompt niche selection.
- [ ] EC-20: Keywords extraction returns 0 keywords (empty title+bullets+description) → show "No keywords available" message on Keywords tab.
- [ ] EC-21: Competition tab finds 0 similar designs → show "No similar products found" empty state.
- [ ] EC-22: Live Research streaming — scraper returns products in batches; if a batch has 0 new products, skeleton cards remain until next batch or completion.
- [ ] EC-23: Card hover on touch device (no hover) → action icons always visible on mobile/tablet.
- [ ] EC-24: Detail page navigated to directly via URL (no search context) → page loads product data via ASIN lookup; back button returns to research page with empty results.
- [ ] EC-25: Statistics view with 0 results → show "Run a search first" empty state.

### Phase 6 (amendment 2026-03-29)
- [ ] EC-26: User clicks Stop during pending (before any products) → UI resets cleanly, no stale skeletons.
- [ ] EC-27: User clicks Stop during running (some products loaded) → already-loaded products remain visible, skeletons removed.
- [ ] EC-28: Infinite scroll: Amazon returns 0 products on next page → `canLoadMore=false`, no more scroll triggers.
- [ ] EC-29: User changes product type mid-scroll → resets to page 1, clears accumulated products, new search with new type.
- [ ] EC-30: Best Sellers sort returns many branded products → BrandBlacklist filters them (no UI change needed).

### Phase 7 (amendment 2026-04-07)
- [ ] EC-31: DB search returns < 100 products total → all shown immediately, no scroll loading triggered.
- [ ] EC-32: User scrolls fast (multiple scroll events) → debounce/throttle prevents duplicate page fetches. Only one request in-flight at a time.
- [ ] EC-33: Filter change while next page is loading → in-flight request cancelled, results reset, new search with `page=1`.
- [ ] EC-34: Browser tab hidden during scroll loading → fetch completes normally, products appended when tab regains focus.

## Dependencies

- PROJ-4 (Workspace & Membership — workspace scope)
- PROJ-5 (Niche List — "Add to Niche" action calls `POST /api/niches/`)
- PROJ-10 (Keyword Research & Bank — "Save to Keyword Bank" from detail page keywords tab)
- PROJ-11 (Listing Generator — "Use as Listing Template" creates listing draft)
- PROJ-16 (Amazon Product Scraper — scrape engine, models, BSRSnapshot, PriceSnapshot)

## Amendments (PROJ-15/18/19 Harmonization)

### Vector DB Integration (PROJ-15)
- `AmazonProduct` model is an embeddable source. `get_embedding_text()` returns `title + " " + brand + " " + bullets`.
- `post_save` signal on AmazonProduct enqueues embedding job.
- Enables cross-niche product discovery via semantic search (e.g. "find similar products across all niches").

### Web Search Integration (PROJ-17)
- Web Search results that reference Amazon products can be linked to existing AmazonProduct records via ASIN matching.
- "Save to Niche" quick-action from PROJ-17 Chat can trigger "Add to Niche List" (same as existing UI action).

### Agent Integration (PROJ-18)
- Research Agent has tools: `trigger_product_research`, `read_product_results`, `filter_product_results`.
- Agent can start Live Research, read results, and apply filters (BSR range, rating, reviews, price, product type, hide brands).
- Agent permission default for `trigger_product_research`: Approve (costs scraper credits). `filter_product_results` + `read_product_results` = Auto.

### Amendment Log (2026-03-28)

All bugs, UI improvements, and new features from the original amendments section have been promoted to formal Acceptance Criteria:

- **7 Bug fixes** → AC-18 to AC-24 (Phase 2)
- **7 UI improvements** → AC-25 to AC-28 (Phase 3: Card Redesign)
- **Detail page overhaul** → AC-29 to AC-36 (Phase 4: Detail Page)
- **Statistics + Live UX** → AC-37 to AC-41 (Phase 5)
- **3 QA low-severity bugs** (BUG-11, BUG-12, BUG-13) → AC-39, AC-40, AC-41

**Design note:** Product Card and Detail Page exact styling to be decided via `/frontend-design`. Flying Research "Design Detail Page" is the primary reference.

**Scraper note:** PROJ-16 may need `PriceSnapshot` model + keyword extraction support for AC-33, AC-34.

### B) Mode Toggle Behavior (Live vs DB)

| Feature | Live Research (Switch ON) | DB Research (Switch OFF) |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| API called | `POST /api/research/search/` | `GET /api/research/products/` |
| Trigger | On Search button press | On Search button + any filter change |
| Advanced filters | Disabled (dimmed) except Product Type + Hide Official Brands | All filters active |
| Sorting | Hidden (Amazon order) | Active |
| Pagination | Hidden (shows all scraped) | 50/page |
| Export CSV | Hidden | Active (disabled if 0 results) |
| Loading UX | LinearProgress + polling every 3s + MUI Skeleton | MUI Skeleton on initial load |
| Results freshness | Live from Amazon (max 24h cache) | From DB, may be days old |

---

### C) Data Flow

```
LIVE MODE — "funny cat shirts"
  UI → POST /api/research/search/ { keyword, marketplace, product_type }
     ← { cache_id, status: "pending" }
  UI polls GET /api/research/search/{cache_id}/status/ every 3s
     ← { status: "running", pages_done: 2, products_scraped: 47 }
     ← { status: "completed", products: [...paginated...] }
  [If status = "failed" → error banner + Retry button]

DB MODE — "funny cat shirts"
  UI → GET /api/research/products/?keyword=...&bsr_min=...&sort_by=bsr_asc&page=1
     ← { count: 312, results: [...50 products...], next, previous }
  Filter change → immediate re-fetch with updated params
```

---

### D) Backend — New Django App: `research_app`

**Why a new app?**
`scraper_app` owns the engine (Scrapy jobs, models, scheduling) and has no user context.
`research_app` adds the user-facing API layer: authentication, workspace scope, FTS filtering, autocomplete proxy. Clean separation — PROJ-16 can run headless without PROJ-7.

**New Django app:** `django-app/research_app/`

| Endpoint | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `GET /api/research/suggestions/` | Proxies Amazon autocomplete via `httpx`. Redis cache 60s per (query, marketplace). Returns `string[]`. |
| `POST /api/research/search/` | Checks `ProductSearchCache` (workspace-scoped) for fresh result (<24h). If stale/missing: creates `ScrapeJob` + `ProductSearchCache(workspace=...)`, enqueues `scrape_keyword_job` via django-rq. Returns `{ cache_id, status }`. Deduplicates concurrent requests for same keyword. |
| `GET /api/research/search/{cache_id}/status/` | Returns `{ status, pages_done, products_scraped, error_log }`. When completed: includes first page of products. |
| `GET /api/research/products/` | PG full-text search (`SearchVector` + `SearchRank`) across `title`, `brand`, `bullet_1`, `bullet_2`, `description`. All DB filters + sort applied server-side. Paginated 50/page. |
| `GET /api/research/products/export/` | Same query, no pagination. `StreamingHttpResponse` CSV — avoids loading full dataset in memory. |
| `GET /api/research/products/{asin}/bsr-history/` | Last 30 days of `BSRSnapshot` for given ASIN + marketplace. |

---

### E) Database Changes & Data Ownership

**One migration** added to `scraper_app` (model stays there, PROJ-7 adds a field):

- `ProductSearchCache` gains a `workspace` FK → `workspace_app.Workspace` (`null=True, blank=True` for existing rows)
- All `research_app` views filter `ProductSearchCache` by `request.user`'s active workspace
- `AmazonProduct` stays global — shared market data, no workspace FK

**Data ownership (decided 2026-03-14):**
- **AmazonProduct** = global, no User/Workspace FK — saves scrape costs (same keyword scraped once, used by all users within 24h cache)
- **ProductSearchCache** = workspace-scoped — tracks "who triggered this search" for polling + history
- **Niche** (PROJ-5) = workspace-scoped — "Add to Niche List" links keyword to user's workspace
- Identity flow: UI → PROJ-7 API (authenticated) → ProductSearchCache(workspace) → PROJ-16 scrape engine (no user context)

---

### F) Full-Text Search Strategy (DB Research)

- `SearchVector` across: `title` (weight A), `brand` (weight B), `bullet_1` + `bullet_2` (weight C), `description` (weight D)
- `GIN` index on the search vector for fast lookups (added in migration)
- `SearchRank` used when `sort_by` is not specified (relevance order)
- If `keyword` param is empty → skip FTS, return all products for marketplace + filters

---

### G) Frontend State Management

| State | Storage | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Research mode (Live/DB) | `useState` | Page-local |
| Keyword | `useState` | Drives both modes |
| Marketplace | `localStorage` + `useState` | Key: `mm-research-marketplace`, default: `amazon_com` |
| Recent searches | `localStorage` | Key: `mm-research-recent`, max 10 FIFO |
| Filter values (sliders, dates, etc.) | `useState` (object) | Reset to defaults on mode switch |
| Each range filter enabled/disabled | `useState` (per-filter bool) | Drives slider enable/disable switch state |
| Layout toggle (Grid/List) | `useState` | Page-local |
| API data | RTK Query `researchApi` slice | Mirrors `nicheSlice.ts` pattern |
| Polling (Live mode) | RTK Query `pollingInterval: 3000` | Stops when `status !== 'pending'` |

**New RTK Query slice:** `store/researchSlice.ts`

---

### H) Tech Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| MUI Switch for Live/DB toggle | Binary on/off is clearer than ToggleButton for a mode change. Placed left of search input so it's seen before typing. |
| Slider panel (not chip+popover) | Reference tools (MerchMatrix, Flying Research) use sliders — the target users are already familiar. More efficient for range inputs than chip+popover interactions. |
| Per-filter enable/disable Switch | User can quickly turn off a filter without losing the range values — matches the reference UI pattern. |
| Star rating selector | More intuitive than a numeric range for "minimum rating" — single click sets the floor. |
| Hide Official Brands as full-width Button | Toggle-button affordance (active/inactive) is immediately scannable. `secondary.main` (#00C8D7) when active signals it's filtering data. |
| `httpx` for autocomplete proxy | Async-compatible, modern, consistent with Django async views if adopted later. |
| MUI Skeleton during polling | Better perceived performance than spinner alone — users see the shape of the data before it arrives. |
| `@mui/x-charts` for BSR sparkline | Already in `package.json`. Consistent with MUI ecosystem. |
| Inline detail panel (not drawer) | Faster comparison across products — user doesn't lose list context. Drawers reserved for deep editing (Niche detail). |
| `research_app` separate from `scraper_app` | Separation of concerns — engine vs user API. Allows PROJ-16 to evolve independently. |
| `StreamingHttpResponse` for CSV | No memory spike on 500+ product exports. |

---

### I) New Packages

**Backend:** No new packages — `httpx`, `django-rq`, `redis` already installed.

**Frontend:** No new packages — `@mui/x-data-grid` and `@mui/x-charts` confirmed present in `package.json`.

### J) Environment Variables

```
SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY=  # Used by PROJ-16 scraper engine (already set)
```

## Tech Design Amendment: Phases 2-5 (2026-03-28)

> Added: 2026-03-28 | Extends the original Tech Design (sections A-K) for Phase 1.

### L) Phase 2 — Bug Fixes (AC-18 to AC-24)

All fixes are in existing components — no new files or endpoints needed.

| Bug | Component | Fix |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| Search triggers on keystroke (AC-18) | `SearchBar.tsx` | Remove `onSearch` call from Autocomplete `onChange`; only fire from Enter keydown + Search button click |
| Sort-by not applied (AC-19) | `ControlsRow.tsx` + `useFilterState` | Verify `sort_by` param is passed to `listProducts` query; check backend `ProductListView` ordering |
| Wrong BSR (AC-20) | `ProductCard.tsx` | Verify `product.bsr` field mapping (not a stale field) |
| Review count missing (AC-21) | `ProductCard.tsx` | Add `reviews_count` display next to star rating |
| Review filter broken (AC-22) | `AdvancedOptionsPanel.tsx` + backend `ProductListView` | Verify `reviews_min`/`reviews_max` params flow through `useFilterState` → query params → backend filter |
| Bullets/Description broken (AC-23) | `ProductDetailPanel.tsx` | Fix layout: bullets as `<ul>`, description as `<Typography>` with 3-line clamp + expand toggle, proper overflow |
| Listed date missing (AC-24) | `ProductCard.tsx` | Show `listed_date` formatted (e.g. "2025-05-28") alongside existing "Published Xd ago" |

---

### M) Phase 3 — Product Card Redesign (AC-25 to AC-28)

> Design decided: 2026-03-28 | `/frontend-design` session | Option B "Data Dashboard"

**Card Visual Tree (final):**
```
ProductCard (fixed height: 370px, width: 100% of grid cell)
│
├── Image Area (height: 220px, design-cropped)
│   ├── [HOVER ONLY] Favorite/Heart icon (top-left)
│   │   size: 28px container, 18px icon
│   │   color: error.main when active, text.secondary when inactive
│   │   bg: glass-sm circle
│   ├── [HOVER ONLY] AI badge (top-right, if slogan extracted)
│   │   size: 28px, bg: secondary.dark, icon: AutoAwesome 16px white
│   │   border-radius: sm (6px)
│   ├── [HOVER ONLY] Action row (bottom center, gap: 12px):
│   │   icons: 20px, color: text.primary
│   │   [SaveAltOutlined]       → download thumbnail
│   │   [ContentCopyOutlined]   → copy ASIN + notistack
│   │   [OpenInNewOutlined]     → open on Amazon
│   │   [ArrowForwardOutlined]  → navigate to detail page
│   └── Hover overlay: gradient
│       top: rgba(background.default, 0.70) → transparent 30%
│       bottom: transparent 60% → rgba(background.default, 0.80)
│       transition: opacity 150ms ease
│       Touch fallback (@media (hover: none)): always visible, opacity 0.6
│
├── BSR Sparkline Row (height: 30px, padding: 0 14px)
│   @mui/x-charts SparkLineChart (if >= 2 BSR data points)
│   color: secondary.main (via theme token)
│   area fill: secondary.subtle (via theme token)
│   If < 2 data points: row empty (height preserved for grid alignment)
│
└── Info Area (height: 120px, padding: 12px 14px)
    ├── Row 1 (flex, space-between):
    │   BSR: TrendingUp icon (16px) + value (body2, 500)
    │         color: success.main (<10k), warning.main (10k-50k), text.secondary (>50k)
    │   Sales: ShoppingCart icon (14px, text.secondary) + value (body2)
    │   Price: "$" (text.secondary) + value (body2, 600)
    └── Row 2 (flex, space-between):
        Stars: 5× Star icons (14px), filled=warning.main, empty=text.disabled
        Reviews: "/ {count} review(s)" (caption, text.secondary)
        ASIN: Chip variant="outlined" size="small", mono font, onClick→copy
```

**Card grid columns:**
```
xs: 6 (2 per row)   sm: 6 (2)   md: 4 (3)   lg: 3 (4)   xl: 2.4 (5)
spacing: 2 (16px)
```

**Card specs (all via design system tokens — no hardcoded colors):**
```
background:     theme.vars.palette.background.paper
border:         1px solid theme.vars.palette.divider
border-radius:  12px (lg)
overflow:       hidden
cursor:         pointer
hover:          translateY(-2px), elevation.2 shadow (150ms ease)

Image:
  object-fit:       cover
  object-position:  center 20% (shifts up to focus on print area)
  height:           220px
  width:            100%
  background:       theme.vars.palette.background.default (fallback)

Numeric values: font-feature-settings: 'tnum' (tabular nums)
ASIN: mono font stack (JetBrains Mono)
```

**Key decisions:**
- No title or brand on card — moved to detail page (AC-27)
- BSR sparkline on card = instant trend visibility, unique differentiator vs competitors
- BSR value = `product.bsr` (main category rank); subcategory ranks on detail page only
- Sparkline uses existing `getBSRHistory` RTK query (lazy, per-card, cached)
- Hover overlay via CSS `:hover` + gradient; touch fallback via `@media (hover: none)`
- Card click navigates to detail page route, NOT inline expand (AC-28)
- All colors via `theme.vars.palette.*` — zero hardcoded hex values

---

### N) Phase 4 — Product Detail Page (AC-29 to AC-36)

> Design decided: 2026-03-28 | `/frontend-design` session | Option B "Data Dashboard" — scrollable single page, no tabs

**New route:** `/amazon/research/product/:asin`

**Page Visual Tree:**

```

**Design philosophy: "Product Dossier"**
- Everything on one scrollable page — no tabs, no hidden content
- KPI row at top for instant metrics overview
- Image + Chart side-by-side = visual + data in one glance
- Sections flow naturally: metrics → visual → keywords → price → competition
- Differentiator vs Flying Research (tabs) and MerchMatrix (table-only)

**New API endpoints (5 total, all in `research_app`):**

| Endpoint | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `GET /api/research/products/{asin}/` | Returns full `AmazonProduct` fields + `meta_keywords` M2M (short_tail + long_tail with frequency) for a single ASIN+marketplace. 404 if not found. |
| `GET /api/research/products/{asin}/similar/` | Returns products with overlapping `meta_keywords` M2M in the same marketplace. Limit 20, exclude self. |
| `GET /api/research/products/{asin}/same-brand/` | Returns products with same `brand` + `marketplace`, excluding self. Limit 20. |
| `GET /api/research/products/{asin}/price-history/` | Returns `BSRSnapshot` records (price field) for last 90 days. Reuses existing `BSRSnapshot` model (already has `price` field). |
| `POST /api/research/products/{asin}/use-as-template/` | Accepts `{ niche_id }`. Creates a Listing draft (PROJ-11) pre-populated with product title, bullets, description. Returns listing ID. Requires active workspace membership. |

**Reused existing infrastructure (no new endpoints):**
- **Keywords per product:** `AmazonProduct.meta_keywords` M2M → `MetaKeyword` model (short_tail/long_tail + frequency). Populated by scraper pipeline (`keyword_extractor.py`). Included in product detail serializer.
- **Keywords per search:** `SearchKeywordResult` model (top_focus_keywords, top_long_tail_keywords, all_keywords_flat). Populated by `DjangoORMPipeline.close_spider()`. Accessed via `ProductSearchCache.keyword_result`.
- **Save keywords to niche:** `POST /api/niches/{niche_id}/keywords/bulk-add/` (keyword_app). Use `source=amazon_search`.
- **Statistics/aggregation:** Frontend reads `SearchKeywordResult` from the current search cache status response — no separate aggregation endpoint needed.

**BSR History endpoint change:** Extend existing `BSRHistoryView` from 30 days → 90 days (change timedelta filter).

**Data for BSR summary (calculated server-side):**
- Overall trend: compare first 30-day avg vs last 30-day avg → "Up" / "Down" / "Stable"
- Current trend: compare last 7 days avg vs prior 7 days → "Up" / "Down" / "Stable"
- Average: mean of all BSR snapshots in range
- Median: middle value of all BSR snapshots in range

---

### O) Phase 5 — Statistics View & Live Research UX (AC-37 to AC-41)

**Statistics view:**
- Toggle between "Products" and "Keywords" view in the results toolbar (MUI ToggleButtonGroup or Tab)
- Keywords view calls `GET /api/research/statistics/` with same filter params as product list
- Display: keyword chips with frequency count, sorted by count desc
- Each keyword clickable → pre-fills search bar with that keyword

**Live Research skeleton streaming (AC-38):**
- During `status: running`, poll returns `products_scraped` count
- Show `products_scraped` Skeleton cards; as poll returns new count, add more skeletons
- On `status: completed`, replace skeletons with actual product cards from response
- Progressive feel: skeleton count grows with each poll response

**Minor fixes (AC-39, AC-40, AC-41):**
- Double pagination: add `hideFooterPagination` prop to `ProductTable` DataGrid
- Copy ASINs: change label to "Copy {count} ASINs" showing current page count
- CSV export: use `buildQueryParams()` (respects `enabled` state) instead of raw `filters` object

**New route in App.tsx:**
```
<Route path="/amazon/research/product/:asin" element={<ProductDetailPage />} />
```

---

### Q) RTK Query Slice Updates

**New endpoints to add to `researchApi` (store/researchSlice.ts):**

| Endpoint | Tag | Cache |
|----------|-----|-------|
| `getProductDetail` | `ProductDetail` | Per ASIN (includes meta_keywords) |
| `getSimilarProducts` | `SimilarProducts` | Per ASIN |
| `getSameBrandProducts` | `SameBrandProducts` | Per ASIN |
| `getPriceHistory` | `PriceHistory` | Per ASIN |
| `useAsTemplate` | Mutation (invalidates `Listings`) | N/A |

Existing `getBSRHistory` updated to pass `days=90` param.

---

### R) Tech Decisions (Phases 2-5)

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Detail page as route (not drawer/inline) | User wanted Flying Research style: full page with tabs for deep analysis. Also avoids re-rendering the product grid on detail open. |
| BSR chart 90 days (up from 30) | More data for trend analysis; BSRSnapshot already stores daily. UI can zoom to 30 days. |
| Server-side keyword extraction | Product text is already in DB; no need for client-side NLP. Server can cache results. Reuses `MetaKeyword` model when available. |
| Statistics via dedicated endpoint | Aggregation query across 50-500 products would be expensive client-side. Server computes once, caches per search. |
| Hover overlay for card actions | Clean card surface by default; actions on demand. Touch devices fallback to always-visible. |
| `use-as-template` as POST | Creates a resource (Listing draft); POST is semantically correct. Requires niche context. |
| Price history from BSRSnapshot | BSRSnapshot already has `price` field recorded daily. No need for separate `PriceSnapshot` model. |
| Carousel component (reusable) | Same pattern needed for "Similar Designs" and "Same Brand" — extract once, use twice. |

- [x] Error toast on failure
- [x] Button disabled while creating

#### AC-12: Progress indicator during Live Research scrape
- [x] LiveProgressBanner with LinearProgress
- [x] Shows "Scraping Amazon..." text + page count + products found count
- [x] Visible during pending/running status

#### AC-13: Live Research error state with Retry button

- [x] Default `amazon_com` in `getInitialMarketplace()`
- [x] localStorage key `mm-research-marketplace`
- [x] Restored on page load via `useEffect`

### Edge Cases Status

#### EC-1: Amazon autocomplete returns empty
- [x] Backend returns empty array on exception; frontend renders no suggestions

#### EC-2: Live Research scrape returns 0 products
- [x] EmptyState component with "No products found on Amazon for this keyword" message

#### EC-3: Duplicate scrape for same keyword while previous running
- [x] `get_or_create_keyword_cache()` returns existing in-progress cache

#### EC-4: exclude_words with special characters treated as plain text
- [x] Backend uses `title__icontains` (Django LIKE, not regex) -- safe

#### EC-5: Large result set 500+ products with 50/page pagination
- [x] Server-side pagination with page/page_size params
- [x] `max_value=100` on page_size serializer prevents abuse

#### EC-6: BSR min > max returns 400
- [x] `ProductFilterSerializer.validate()` checks bsr_min > bsr_max
- [x] Also validates reviews_min > reviews_max and price_min > price_max

#### EC-7: hide_official_brands as static fixture
- [x] `official_brands.json` loaded once at module level

#### EC-8: BSR history < 2 data points shows "Not enough history"
- [x] `hasChart = bsrHistory.length >= 2`; shows "Not enough history yet" label

#### EC-9: DB Research no stored products suggests Live Research
- [x] EmptyState in DB mode shows "Try Live Research" button
- [x] Button calls `toggleMode` to switch to Live mode (correct behavior -- user then searches)

#### EC-10: Live Research failed -> error toast + inline error + Retry
- [x] LiveProgressBanner shows Alert with error + Retry button

#### EC-11: Recent chip clicked while scrape in progress
- [x] RTK Query automatically unsubscribes from old cacheId when new cacheId is set
- [x] Old polling stops implicitly via cache key change (acceptable RTK Query pattern)

#### EC-12: CSV export with 0 results -> button disabled
- [x] `disabled={count === 0}` on Export CSV button

#### EC-13: CSV export streams for large sets
- [x] `StreamingHttpResponse` with `iterator(chunk_size=200)`

#### EC-14: localStorage recent searches FIFO max 10
- [x] `.slice(0, MAX_ITEMS)` after prepending new entry

#### EC-15: User clears search input -> recent chips remain visible
- [x] Recent chips rendered independently of keyword state

### Security Audit Results

- [x] Authentication: All 6 endpoints use `CookieJWTAuthentication` + `IsAuthenticated`
- [x] Authorization: `SearchStatusView` checks workspace ownership; `LiveSearchView` requires active workspace membership
- [x] Global rate limiting: DRF throttle classes configured in settings.py
- [x] Suggestions proxy: uses `httpx params={}` dict for safe URL encoding (FIXED)
- [x] ASIN validation: regex `^[A-Z0-9]{10}$` on BSR history endpoint (FIXED)
- [x] Input validation: All inputs validated via DRF serializers with `is_valid(raise_exception=True)`
- [x] XSS: No raw HTML rendering; React escapes output by default
- [x] CORS: Handled globally via django-cors-headers
- [x] SQL injection: All queries via Django ORM (parameterized)
- [x] `exclude_words` uses `icontains` not regex -- safe from ReDoS
- [x] CSV export uses `StreamingHttpResponse` -- no memory DoS on large exports
- [x] `page_size` capped at 100 via serializer `max_value` -- prevents large payload responses
- [x] `AmazonProduct` intentionally global (no workspace FK) per spec section E -- not a vulnerability

### Bugs Found

#### BUG-1: FIXED -- Suggestions proxy URL now uses httpx params dict
- Previously: `q` parameter was interpolated raw into Amazon URL
- Now: `client.get(url, params={'prefix': q, 'mid': mid, 'alias': 'aps'})` (line 249)

#### BUG-2: CLOSED (spec clarification) -- rating_max not needed
- Spec's star-click UI (AC-7) defines "minimum rating" only. No max rating UI exists.
- `rating_min` is implemented. No `rating_max` needed.

#### BUG-3: FIXED -- Hide Official Brands stays active in Live mode
- AdvancedOptionsPanel now dims only DB-only controls per-section
- Hide Official Brands button (center column) remains clickable in Live mode

#### BUG-4: FIXED -- Polling stops on terminal state
- Single `usePollSearchStatusQuery` call with `pollingInterval: shouldPoll && !isTerminal ? POLL_INTERVAL : 0`
- No duplicate hook calls

#### BUG-5: FIXED -- All frontend tests passing (88/88)
- Tests rewritten to match actual rendered output

#### BUG-6: CLOSED -- RTK Query handles cache key change automatically
- When `cacheId` changes, RTK Query unsubscribes from old key. Implicit but correct.

#### BUG-7: FIXED -- Same as BUG-1

#### BUG-8: FIXED -- ASIN validation added
- `re.match(r'^[A-Z0-9]{10}$', asin)` with 400 response on invalid format

#### BUG-9: CLOSED (by design) -- AmazonProduct is global per spec

#### BUG-10: FIXED -- Pagination URLs now preserve all query params
- Uses `request.query_params.copy()` as base, updates page/page_size

#### BUG-11 (NEW): Double pagination controls in List view
- **Severity:** Low
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Search for a keyword in DB mode with 50+ results
  2. Switch to List view layout
  3. Expected: One pagination control
  4. Actual: DataGrid renders its own built-in pagination footer AND `AmazonResearchView` renders a separate `TablePagination` component below. Two pagination bars visible.
- **File:** `AmazonResearchView.tsx` lines 254-264 (parent TablePagination) + `ProductTable.tsx` DataGrid with no `hideFooterPagination` prop
- **Fix:** Either add `hideFooterPagination` to DataGrid, or remove the parent `TablePagination` when `layout === 'list'`
- **Priority:** Fix in next sprint

#### BUG-12 (NEW): "Copy ASINs" copies only current page, not all results
- **Severity:** Low
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Search for keyword with 200+ results in DB mode
  2. Click "Copy ASINs" button
  3. Expected: All matching ASINs copied (button label says "Copy ASINs")
  4. Actual: Only ASINs from current page (max 50) are copied. `products` prop only contains current page data.
- **File:** `ResultsToolbar.tsx` line 39 -- `products.map((p) => p.asin)`
- **Note:** May be intentional (copying 500+ ASINs could be unwieldy). Clarify with product owner. If intentional, label should say "Copy Page ASINs" or show count.
- **Priority:** Nice to have (clarify intent)

#### BUG-13 (NEW): CSV export sends disabled filter values
- **Severity:** Low
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Search in DB mode without enabling any range sliders
  2. Click "Export CSV"
  3. Expected: Export uses same filters as displayed results
  4. Actual: `handleExportCSV` passes entire `filters` object as params, including disabled filter defaults (e.g., `bsr_min=1&bsr_max=500000`). The `enabled` state is not consulted.
- **File:** `ResultsToolbar.tsx` line 50 -- `const params = { ...filters }`
- **Note:** In practice, the default range values (1-500000 BSR, 0-10000 reviews, $1-$100) span the full spectrum, so results are not incorrectly narrowed. But the export query differs from the list query (which checks `enabled` flags). This could cause subtle mismatches if a user has partially adjusted a slider but toggled it off.
- **Fix:** Pass the same `buildQueryParams()` output to the export, or pass enabled flags to ResultsToolbar.
- **Priority:** Fix in next sprint
